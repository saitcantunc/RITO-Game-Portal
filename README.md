## Reflection

-The purpose of this project was to improve myself in HTML and CSS.

-When I started the project, my aim was to take advantage of all the possibilities of CSS.

-I made the project using Visual Studio Code

-I preferred to use Sass in the project. Because it provided opportunities such as nesting, mixins, inheritance and I wanted to try it. I tried to use the opportunities it offered to the best of my ability.
